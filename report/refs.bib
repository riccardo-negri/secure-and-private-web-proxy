abstract="The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol was introduced to solve the lack of security and privacy in the early versions of the world wide web. However, even though it has substantially evolved over the years, certain features still present privacy issues. One such feature is the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension, which allows multiple web servers to reside behind a provider hosting multiple domains with the same IP address; at the same time it allows third parties to discover the domains that end users visit. In the last few years, the Encrypted Server Name Indication (ESNI) Internet draft is being developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF); this encrypted variant of the extension was renamed to Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) in latest versions. In this paper, we measure the adoption of both these versions, given that they have substantial differences. By analyzing the top 1M domains in terms of popularity, we identify that only a small portion, less than 19{\%}, supports the privacy-preserving ESNI extension and practically no domain supports ECH. Overall, these results demonstrate that there is still a long way to go to ensure the privacy of end users visiting TLS-protected domains which are co-located behind a common Internet-facing server.",

abstract = {Global Internet users increasingly rely on virtual private network (VPN) services to preserve their privacy, circumvent censorship, and access geo-filtered content. Due to their own lack of technical sophistication and the opaque nature of VPN clients, however, the vast majority of users have limited means to verify a given VPN service's claims along any of these dimensions. We design an active measurement system to test various infrastructural and privacy aspects of VPN services and evaluate 62 commercial providers. Our results suggest that while commercial VPN services seem, on the whole, less likely to intercept or tamper with user traffic than other, previously studied forms of traffic proxying, many VPNs do leak user traffic---perhaps inadvertently---through a variety of means. We also find that a non-trivial fraction of VPN providers transparently proxy traffic, and many misrepresent the physical location of their vantage points: 5--30\% of the vantage points, associated with 10\% of the providers we study, appear to be hosted on servers located in countries other than those advertised to users.},
